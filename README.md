# Smart Digital Twin for Predictive Maintenance of Electro-Mechanical Systems

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is developed as part of the **Intel Unnati Industrial Training Program**.  
The project focuses on building a **Smart Digital Twin** for **Predictive Maintenance of Electro-Mechanical Systems** using **Reduced-Order Modelling (ROM)** and **Machine Learning techniques**.

The Digital Twin acts as a virtual representation of a physical electro-mechanical system, enabling early fault detection, performance monitoring, and predictive maintenance to reduce downtime and maintenance costs.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To design a Smart Digital Twin for electro-mechanical systems
- To apply Reduced-Order Modelling (ROM) for system simplification
- To integrate Machine Learning for predictive maintenance
- To predict system health and potential failures in advance
- To improve reliability and efficiency of maintenance strategies

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Traditional maintenance methods are either reactive or scheduled, leading to unexpected failures or unnecessary maintenance.  
This project aims to overcome these limitations by using a **Digital Twin combined with AI/ML models** to predict failures before they occur.
